There\'s the computer on your own desk, of course, and another one at the other end where the other person is sitting, ready to communicate with you. But in between your two machines, making communication between them possible, there are probably about a dozen other computers bridging the gap. Collectively, all the world\'s linked-up computers are called the Internet. How do they talk to one another?</p><p>When we talk about the Internet, what we’re actually referring to is an interconnected network of computers (hence, internet). Some of these computers are web servers, which are just specialized computers that contain and serve content from your favorite websites, and others are just the client devices we use everyday, like our laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.</p> For now, let’s ignore our own internet connected devices and focus on those web servers. Let’s imagine each of these web servers as a tall building and that they’re connected to each other via highways and roads. This network of highways and roads (which is made up of fiberoptic cables around the world) can be thought of as the Internet, and what travels along these highways and roads is data. Just like how physical buildings in real life have a mailing address, each of our web servers (which represents our favorite web sites like ESPN.com or Facebook.com) have a unique address called an ip address. <p>Now you might ask, “What about us? How do we connect to the internet?” That’s where our Internet Service Providers (ISP’s) come into play. You can imagine them as special buildings that allow our client devices to connect to the highways and roads. Continuing with our analogy, just think of each of our internet connected devices as a house with a driveway that leads to the ISP’s. And once your house is hooked up to the internet, you’re good to go!</p><h2>What is HTML?</h2>When you chat to somebody on the Net or send them an e-mail, do you ever stop to think how many different computers you are using in the process?
